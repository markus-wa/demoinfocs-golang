Some interesting data regarding flashes.

player time flash-duration
10 49m0.613347564s 0
10 49m50.54364714s 3.4198754
10 49m53.122207212s 3.8876143
10 49m54.84124726s 2.1688643
10 49m58.552811s 0

Going by the last two lines, the player should not have been blinded at ~49m57.0, but he was only cleared at ~49m58.5

This isn't very conclusive but it looks like IsFlashed isn't super reliable currently.
